        <p>
          <span>Envision Tier</span> - Your Skills Seminar Speaker will be a more senior professional specifically identified for your target population, and their identity (gender, race, ethnicity, story) along with their career field will be taken into consideration specifically for your target audience, so they can help your participants envision what their pathway could look like.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span>Insight Tier</span> â€“ Your Skills Seminar Speaker will be one of our incredible professionals who can provide insight about the topic from an early to mid-career professional lens with the Seminar at the day and time most convenient for your needs. Does not include Leadership topics. *
